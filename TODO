-install has problems when I compile "libExtractBoundary.so". It can not find shared library. So the 
  "install" command in cmake should install the file of library too.

- also, install command in cmake should install the license file, doc and man pages.
  currently, the option -l (for license) gives us error.
  $ extractboundary -l # it can not find license file.

- in CommandLineParser, two methods "FindInputFileArgument" and "FindOutputFileArgument" should
  be completed. They aim to find input and output filenames from argv[], and leave other options.

- installer should detect it ParaView is installed, and automatically copy *.so file inside plugin folder.

- intaller also can detect if vtk (a minimum vtk) is installed or not.

- support both vtk and vtu (reader)

- MAC issues:
  in ExtractBoundary.cxx, in FindNormal function, at lines 737 and 748, Polygon is defined as "array" of objects,
  which each object is vtkIdList class. It seams that compilers in MAC doies not support smart pointer when the pointer 
  is an array itself. So instead of:
      vtkSmartPointer<vtkIList> Polygons[NumberOfPolygons] = vtkSmartPointer<vtkIdList>::New();
  use:
      vtkIList *Polygons[NumberOfPolygons] = vtkIdList::New(); ;
  and then delete
    delete [] Polygons;Q

- MAC issues in CMakeLists.txt
  All part of "Compiler flags" in the CMakeLists.txt file should be commented when using MAC!
